/*
 * 1.3 (May 31 2021): 'Fix' high CPU usage during chat-heavy live streams.
 *     This extension is now useless as youtube no longer has these recommendations. This update is
 *     for anyone who still has it installed, as this extension may now interact badly with current-day youtube
 *     and removing it from the webstore does not remove it from their browsers.
 *
 * 1.2 (February 2 2018): Fix hiding the up next video in the polymer design, even if it's recommended.
 *      Fix an issue that caused videos loaded from the 'load more' button to not be
 *      hidden, or even hide the whole extra videos div
 *
 * 1.1 (September 15 2017): Fix missing recs when watching a playlist.
 * 1.0 (November 30 2016): Initial release.
